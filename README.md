### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

⚙️ **GQM Lab Manager**  
An end-to-end software solution for managing and analyzing geotechnical test data from equipment like **GDS** and **VJTech**.  
- 🔬 Supports tests such as **Cyclic Triaxial**, **CIUe/c**, **CAUe/c**, **DSS**, **CSS**, and more  
- 🧩 Developed with **Python (Flask)** backend and **Flutter** frontend  
- 📦 Integrates with **MySQL** for structured data storage  
- 📈 Generates **automated PDF reports** including plots, tables, and calculations  
- 🌐 Interfaces with lab hardware via **LabCom** and supports **KeyLAB** and **AGS** data formats  
- 🧪 Designed to improve efficiency and accuracy across marine geotechnical projects  
- 🧩 **Long-term goal**: to **centralize all lab software** into a single system — including test data processing, **warehouse storage**, and a **QR code-based sample tracking system**
