  ## 🚀 Current Work

  ### Professional: Geotechnical (Offshore) Lab Software
  Leading development of **GQMLab** - a comprehensive LIMS platform that processes GDS and JVtech instrument data, implementing ML pipelines for seabed mechanics predictions and soil analysis.

  **Tech Stack:** Python • Flutter • Docker • Podman • PostgreSQL • Scikit-learn

  ### Research & Tools: Quantum Computing
  Building open-source tools for honest evaluation and education in quantum computing:

  - **[QPL (Quantum Process Language)](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-process-language)** - Relations-first quantum programming language where entanglement is a first-class citizen. Stage 0 & 1 complete: n-qubit systems, GHZ states, proper measurement collapse.

  - **[The QPL Book](https://github.com/dcoldeira/qpl-book)** - Comprehensive guide to quantum computing fundamentals and Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) using QPL. From Bell states to cluster states.

  - **[Quantum Advantage Advisor](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-advantage-advisor)** - Honest evaluation tool that analyzes whether quantum computing actually provides advantage for your specific problem class.

  - **[Photon Duality Simulator](https://github.com/dcoldeira/photon-duality-simulator)** - Wave-particle duality framework using bright/dark state interference with experimentally testable predictions beyond standard QM interpretations.

  **Tech Stack:** Python • NumPy • Qiskit • Mathematical modeling • Physics simulations
